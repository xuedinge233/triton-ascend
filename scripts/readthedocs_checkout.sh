# 2. Cancels PR-preview builds that don't touch this language's docs.
# 3. Creates docs/active -> docs/<lang>/ so the declarative sphinx/python
#    blocks in .readthedocs.yaml don't need to know which language to build.
#
# Kept as a separate script (rather than inline in .readthedocs.yaml) because
# RTD's command runner has been observed to silently abort on multi-line
# YAML scalars with case/if/$()-style constructs.
